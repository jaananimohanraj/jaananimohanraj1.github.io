			<p> Milk chocolate is solid chocolate made with milk (powdered, liquid or condensed). Milk Chocolate is the often considered the best form of chocolate as it is neither bitter nor extra sweet like dark and white chocolate. Milk chocolate only requires 20% of cocoa solids. Milk chocolate is often preferred by most people. Milk chocolate is one of the only types of chocolates liked by people of all ages. </p>
			
			<h2> Dark Chocolate </h2>

			<p> Dark chocolate is essentially pure chocolate, it is produced using a higher percentage of cocoa solids, 70% to 100%. Some other terms used for dark chocolate are semisweet chocolate and/or bittersweet chocolate. Essentially dark chocolate is a healthier version of milk chocolate, which is now considered normal chocolate. Since dark chocolate is bitter, it is not commonly liked amongst younger people. </p>
			
			<h2> White Chocolate </h2>

			<p> White chocolate is made of milk, sugar and cocoa butter, unlike dark and milk chocolate it does not contain cocoa solids. White chocolate is known for being extra sweet, and that is why it is not commonly liked amongst adults. Just how dark chocolate is not commonly liked amongst young adults, teens and children. </p>

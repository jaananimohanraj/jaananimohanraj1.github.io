			<p> Tempered chocolate has a shiny, flawless appearance. It feels firm and breaks off with a snap when you bite into it and it melts smoothly in your mouth, allowing you to fully enjoy the flavor. Slowly heating and cooling melted chocolate while stirring puts it into temper. If chocolate is not tempered properly, the cocoa butter crystallization is uncontrolled and uneven, which results in an unattractive chocolate that is dull or has white streaks running through it. Untempered chocolate may feel rough or tacky and have a cakey, almost chewy texture. And it is more susceptible to heat and humidity, melting more easily and spoiling more quickly. Some simple chocolate recipes do not require tempered chocolate. However, chocolates such as truffles, dipped chocolates, and chocolate bars require tempering to achieve their signature appearance, taste, and texture. </p>
			
			<h2> Chocolate Ganache </h2>

			<p> Ganache is a popular, smooth and thick chocolate paste often used as a frosting on chocolate cake or a filling in chocolate truffles. The story about how it was created says that one day a French pastry master in Paris asked his assistant to melt chocolate and heat cream. The assistant did both and without direction combined the two ingredients. The master saw what had happened and he was infuriated yelling at his assistant that the mixture was a total “ganache” which was an insult back in the days.After the master tried the dark chocolate mistake, he decided to use it; the cakes filled with the chocolate mixture were always sold out. Every time they had to make more, the pastry master would say “hand me the ganache”. </p>
			
			<h2> Chocolate Fondue </h2>
			<img src = "10808841_fpx.jpg" width= "400" height= "300" alt = "Chocolate Fondue" class = "center" />
			<p> Chocolate Fondue is similar to ganache, except for the fact that it is not as thick and it is not used as filling. Ganache is usually used as a cake or truffle filling and is sometimes used as part of a frosting of cakes, or cupcakes. Fondue on the other hand is used as sauce and more specifically is normally used as dipping sauce. Very commonly known things are made with fondue. An example of this is a chocolate covered strawberry. Strawberry's are dipped in chocolate fondue and then cooled to make chocolate strawberries. Fondue is used as a sort of coat for things, like how chocolate covered strawberries are coated with chocolate. Some other things that are dipped in chocolate are other fruits such as bananas, pineapples, and other snacks such as pretzels, and marshmallows.</p>

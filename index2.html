			<p> A chocolate truffle is a type of chocolate confectionary. It is traditionally made with a chocolate ganache centre (melted chocolate and cream) coated in chocolate, cocoa powder, chopped toasted nuts, usually in a spherical, conical or curved shape. Truffles can be made in many different flavours, and with many different chocolates. The most common chocolate truffles are milk chocolate truffles, though dark chocolate shavings are sometimes used to coat these specific truffles. A favourite flavoured truffle would be a mint chocolate truffle. Truffles are coated with tempered chocolate (explained under Melted Chocolates). </p>

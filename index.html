			<h2> The Different Types of Chocolate </h2> 
			<p> There are many types of chocolates. The three most common types if chocolate are milk chocolate, white chocolate, and dark chocolate. Milk chocolate is more commonly liked as it is just the right amount of sweetness, White Chocolate is the second most commonly liked as it is very sweet. The least liked of the three is dark chocolate as it is bitter, yet it is the most healthiest of all three. People often mix in other things, like nuts or dried fruits. In commmon chocolates, like Kit Kat there are wafers, and in Coffee Crisps you have wafers and coffee flavoring. With that in mind, you obviously know that chocolates are often flavoured. Some common chocolate flavours are coffee, mint, cookies and cream, etc. Sometimes you can see that in chocolates like cookies and cream they use different ingredients to replicate the taste. Cookies and cream is white chocolate with little oreo bits mixed into it, giving you the idea of cookies (the oreo bits) and cream (the white chocolate). People also often use caramel in Candy Bars. </p>

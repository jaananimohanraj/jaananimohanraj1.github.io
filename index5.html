			<p> Firstly, fudge is not solely a type of chocolate. Fudge, is a mixture of sugar, milk and butter, it is heated to a stage called the soft-ball stage. The mixture is then beat while it cools to create a smooth creamy consistency. Fudge is often used with chocolate but can also be used with other things like peanut butter, salted caramel and cookie dough.   </p>

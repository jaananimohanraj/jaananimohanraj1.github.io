			<p> Firstly, What is caramel? Caramel is a medium to dark-orange confectionery product made by heating a variety of sugars. It can be used as a flavoring in puddings and desserts, as a filling in bonbons, or as a topping for ice cream and custard. Caramel is often incorporated into chocolates to give it a chewy sort of feel. This is good especially when the chocolates also have hard or crispy ingredients. Giving it a crispy, yet chewy feel. There are many different chocolate bars with caramel in them. Some examples of this are: caramilk, twix, snickers, milky way, galazy, mars, oh henry!, Mr.Big, Skor,etc. There are also different type of caramel, one widely known version is salted caramel. </p>
